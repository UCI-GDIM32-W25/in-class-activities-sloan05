## In Class Activity 2
1.) x = 10

2.) x = 2

3.) This line prints a line of dialogue in the console: "Hello World" every frame.

4.) replace ??? with MonoBehaviour

5.) At the start of the game, it prints x = 10. 

6.) The name of "10" is an argument. It represents the starting amount or number at the beginning of the game. ("x=" + x) is a parameter which represents what we're passing in for x. It will show in the debug log console: x = 10

7.) The _playerTransform variable is instantiated but never used.

8.) Transform.Translate is written incorrectly. It should be replaced with _playerTransform.Translate
